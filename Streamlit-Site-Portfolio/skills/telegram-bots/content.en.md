## Intelligent Telegram Bots

I build not just bots, but complete conversational systems and automated tools that work 24/7 to solve your business challenges. My approach focuses on creating robust, scalable, and easily maintainable architecture.

### Key Capabilities:

*   **Complex Scenarios & Dialogs (FSM):** I design bots capable of guiding users through multi-step scenarios like registration, ordering, surveys, or data collection. The bot "remembers" the context of the conversation with each user, ensuring a smooth and logical interaction.

*   **Modern User Interface:** I create intuitive interfaces using inline buttons, menus, and other interactive elements. This makes interacting with the bot fast and user-friendly.

*   **Integration with External Services:** I can connect your bot to any external service that has an API. This allows for real-time data retrieval (currency rates, weather, order status from a CRM) or sending information from the bot to your systems (e.g., saving leads to Google Sheets or Airtable).

*   **Reliability & Scalability:**
    *   **Deployment:** I deploy bots on a server (VPS) within a Docker container, ensuring their stable 24/7 operation.
    *   **Logging:** I set up a comprehensive logging system to monitor the bot's performance and to quickly identify and resolve any issues.
    *   **Data Persistence:** I use databases (`PostgreSQL`, `SQLite`) to securely store user information, orders, and other critical data.
