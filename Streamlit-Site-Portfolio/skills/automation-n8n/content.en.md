## Business Process Automation with n8n

I build digital pipelines that connect your applications and services, eliminating manual work, reducing errors, and freeing up your time for more important tasks. n8n is a powerful tool that allows for the visual design of complex processes.

### My Services:

*   **Deployment on Your Server:** I will install and configure a self-hosted instance of n8n on your VPS. This ensures that all your data and credentials remain under your complete control, providing maximum security and privacy.

*   **Integration of Any Service:** If a service has an API, I can connect it. I create "bridges" between your tools:
    *   **CRMs and Spreadsheets:** Automatically transfer leads from Telegram/website to Airtable, Supabase, or Google Sheets.
    *   **Messengers and Cloud Storage:** Save attachments from Telegram to Google Drive.
    *   **APIs and Databases:** Fetch data from external APIs and store it in your `PostgreSQL` database.

*   **Scheduled and Trigger-Based Automation:** I set up processes that run automatically:
    *   **Time-based (Cron):** Daily statistics collection, weekly report generation.
    *   **Event-based (Webhook):** Instant reaction to a new event, such as a payment on your website or a form submission.

*   **Notification and Alerting Systems:** I create workflows that monitor important events and immediately notify you via Telegram or Email. For example, an alert for a website going down, a notification for a large order, or a new customer review.

I don't just connect blocks; I design logically sound and resilient pipelines that become the reliable digital backbone of your business.
