About Dataset
Employee Salary Dataset
This is a synthetic dataset generated for educational and machine learning purposes. It is designed for salary prediction as a regression problem and includes realistic employee attributes with logically consistent relationships between features such as education level, job title, experience, and salary.

ðŸ§¾ Dataset Summary
Rows: 10,000
Target Variable: Salary or use column as per your choice
Use Case: Regression, EDA, feature engineering, model evaluation, fairness analysis
ðŸ“Œ Features
Column	Type	Description
Employee_ID	Integer	Unique identifier for each employee
Name	String	Full name (gender-aware generation)
Gender	Categorical	Male or Female
Age	Integer	Age of the employee (based on education level and job title)
Education_Level	Categorical	One of: High School, Bachelor, Master, PhD
Experience_Years	Integer	Number of years of professional experience
Department	Categorical	Business unit, e.g., HR, Engineering, Marketing, etc.
Job_Title	Categorical	Role of the employee, e.g., Analyst, Engineer, Manager, etc.
Location	Categorical	Work location (e.g., New York, San Francisco, etc.)
Salary	Integer	Annual salary in USD (target for regression)
âœ… Characteristics
All entries are complete with no missing values.
The data reflects realistic correlations:
Higher education â†’ Higher job levels â†’ Higher salaries
Interns are younger with low salaries
PhDs are older and placed in senior positions
Salary distributions are varied across departments and locations.
ðŸŽ¯ Applications
This dataset is excellent for:

Linear and nonlinear regression models
Feature importance & engineering
Categorical encoding techniques
Hyperparameter tuning
Fairness and bias detection (e.g., gender-based wage gaps)
Visualization and EDA practice

My Questions:
1. Is there a gender pay gap after accounting for role, location, experience and education?
2. In which departments/roles/locations is the gender gap greatest and most concentrated?
3. What budget is needed to close the gender gap to an acceptable range (e.g. Â±2%)?
4. Where are we paying above/below the expected level given the role, experience, education and location (mispricing pockets)?
5. What are the recommended offer forks (p25â€“p50â€“p75) for the roleÃ—locationÃ—seniority clusters to hit the market and not create compression?
6. Is there salary compression within roles (experience is poorly monetized)?
7. Is the pay delta between managers and IC (Analyst/Engineer) within a department and location sufficient?
8. What are the location bonuses by role/seniority and what is the budgetary impact of staff redistribution scenarios?
9. What is the current payroll and scenario cost: universal indexation at X% and bring-to-median by cluster?
10. What is the salary increment based on education level (Master/PhD) for the same role, experience and location? Is it consistent across departments?
11. Where is female representation below the company average and/or below the target range?
12. Where are there extreme payment anomalies (above/below cluster band) that create retention/compliance risk?
